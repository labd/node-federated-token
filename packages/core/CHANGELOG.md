# @labdigital/federated-token

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- fdde268: Remove the deprecated `CookieTokenSource` from `@labdigital/federated-token`, this is available from `@labdigital/federated-token-express-adapter`
- d134a6b: Remove `HeaderTokenSource` (moved to `@labdigital/federated-token-express-adapter`)
- 87334e6: Move JWE encryption from `A128CBC-HS256` to `A256GCM`
- abf409b: Switch to ESM only builds

### Minor Changes

- de5c70a: Set the expire time on the protected header of the JWT token, in order to read
  it without decryption.
- 3d5baf8: Add ability to set custom expires time for the various cookies. For example:

  ```ts
  const cookieTokenSource = new CookieTokenSource({
    secure: true,
    sameSite: "strict",
    refreshTokenPath: "/refresh",
    userToken: {
      expiresIn: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
    },
  });
  ```

  This will set the user token cookie to expire in 30 days. The default value is when
  the browser is closed.
